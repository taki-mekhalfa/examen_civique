         We explicitly set width/height to 72dp.
         The Android 12 splash window is 108dp, but the "safe" circle is smaller.
         72dp ensures it fits safely in the center without being cropped.
         
         Since your source image is in 'drawable-xxxhdpi', Android will take 
         that high-res image and scale it down nicely to 72dp.
